    Several colour-difference formulas such as CMC, CIE94, and CIEDE2000 have been
    developed by modifying CIELAB. These formulas give much better fits for
    experimental data based on small colour differences than does CIELAB. None of these
    has an associated uniform colour space (UCS). The need for a UCS is demonstrated by
    the widespread use of the a\textasteriskcenteredb\textasteriskcentered diagram
    despite the lack of uniformity. This article describes the development of formulas,
    with the same basic structure as the DIN99 formula, that predict the experimental
    data sets better than do the CMC and CIE94 colour-difference formulas and only
    slightly worse than CIEDE2000 (which was optimized on the experimental data).
    However, these formulas all have an associated UCS. The spaces are similar in form
    to L\textasteriskcentereda\textasteriskcenteredb\textasteriskcentered.
