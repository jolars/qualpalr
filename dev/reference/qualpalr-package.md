# qualpalr: Automatic Generation of Qualitative Color Palettes

Automatic generation of maximally distinct qualitative color palettes,
optionally tailored to color deficiency. A set of colors or a subspace
of a color space is used as input and a final palette of specified size
is generated by picking colors that maximize the minimum pairwise
difference among the chosen colors. Adaptations to color vision
deficiency, background colors, and white points are supported.
