Description: Automatic generation of maximally distinct qualitative color palettes,
    optionally tailored to color deficiency. A set of colors or a subspace of a
    color space is used as input and a final palette of specified size is
    generated by picking colors that maximize the minimum pairwise difference
    among the chosen colors. Adaptations to color vision deficiency,
    background colors, and white points are supported.
