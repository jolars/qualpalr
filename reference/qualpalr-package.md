# qualpalr: Automatic Generation of Qualitative Color Palettes

Automatic generation of maximally distinct qualitative color palettes,
optionally tailored to color deficiency. A list of colors or a subspace
of a color space is used as input and then projected to the DIN99d color
space, where colors that are maximally distinct are chosen
algorithmically.
